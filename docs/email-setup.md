# Email configuration

Mailtrap is the default email service. Fastapi Data Export uses the HTTP Sending API. Credentials stay on the server; the repository contains no account credentials.

## Development and staging

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Keep `MAIL_MODE=sandbox`, set `MAIL_FROM`, `MAILTRAP_SANDBOX_TOKEN`, and numeric `MAILTRAP_INBOX_ID` from the Sandbox API integration page. The ordinary app workflow sends to `https://sandbox.api.mailtrap.io/api/send/{inbox_id}`; messages are captured in that Sandbox. Disable forwarding when external delivery is not intended.

## Production

Verify your sending domain, set `MAIL_MODE=production`, `MAIL_FROM` on that domain, and `MAILTRAP_PRODUCTION_TOKEN` with sending permission. Transactional mail uses `https://send.api.mailtrap.io/api/send`. Both environments use Bearer authentication over HTTPS. Restart after changing configuration. Replace operator/reviewer addresses if used by this app.

## Message details

The `inventory.export` category groups this workflow. `custom_variables.request_id` correlates the stored request with provider logs; `X-Request-Reference` carries its reference in the message headers. Content includes text and escaped HTML. The CSV is base64 encoded in `attachments` with filename, `text/csv` type and `attachment` disposition.

## Previews and failures

`MAIL_MODE=log` with `APP_ENV=development` writes private MIME previews to `.data/mail-preview/`; it makes no network call and is disabled in production. Keep these files private because they can contain addresses and action links.

A provider acceptance response must contain `success: true` and a message ID for each recipient. Accepted means submitted to the provider, not delivered to the inbox. Missing credentials and explicit rejection remain visible as failed; correct configuration and run `python retry_email.py`. Timeouts, server errors, malformed replies, and interrupted sends stay unknown or sending. Inspect provider logs before deciding how to reconcile them; they are not resent automatically. Retries are operator initiated, including rate-limit rejections; wait for the provider's cooldown before retrying.

Existing SMTP settings are no longer read. When upgrading an earlier copy, replace Sandbox username/password with the API token and Sandbox ID; production retains `MAILTRAP_PRODUCTION_TOKEN`. Old queued content messages can still be sent.
